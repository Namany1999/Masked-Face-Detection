# Masked-Face-Detection
This project is a deep learning project for detecting masks in images presented as input. 
It detects whether the person in the image is wearing mask or not.
I have created my own dataset of around 11,000 images in which there are around 5700 masked images and 4400 without mask images.
The ratio of training and testing data is 70:30.
