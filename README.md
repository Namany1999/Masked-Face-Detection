# Masked-Face-Detection
This project is a deep learning project for detecting masks in images presented as input. 
It detects whether the person in the image is wearing mask or not.
I collected around 1000 images and created my own dataset of 10,695 images using Data Augmentation in which there are 5025 masked images and 5670 without mask images.
The ratio of training and testing data is 70:30.
